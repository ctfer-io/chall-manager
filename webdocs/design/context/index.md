A Capture The Flag (CTF) is an event that brings a set of players together, to challenge themselves and others on domain-specific problems.
Those events could have for objective learning, or made for competing with cashprizes.
They could be hold physically, virtually or hybrid.

CTFs are largely adopted in the cybersecurity community, taking place [all over the world on a daily basis](https://ctftime.org).
In this community, plenty domains are played: web, forensic, Active Directory, cryptography, game hacking, telecommunications, steganography, mobile, OSINT, reverse engineering, programming, etc.

In general, a challenge is composed of a name, has a description, a set of hints, files and other data, shared for all. On top of those, the competition runs over points displayed on scoreboards: this is how people keep getting entertained throughout a continuous and hours-long rush.
Most of the challenges find sufficient solutions to their needs with those functionalities, perhaps some does not...

If we consider other aspects of cybersecurity -as infrastructures, telecommunications, satellites, web3 and others- those solutions are not sufficient.
They need specific deployments strategies, and are costfull to deploy even only once.

Nevertheless, with the emergence of the Infrastructure as Code paradigm, we think of infrastructures as reusable components, composing with pieces like for a puzzle. Technologies appeared to embrace this new paradigm, and where used by the cybersecurity community to build CTF infrastructures.
Players could then share infrastructures to play those categories.

In reality, yes they could. But, _de facto_, they share the same infrastructure. If you are using a CTF to select the top players for a larger event, how would you be able to determine who performed better ? How do you assure their success is due to their sole effort and not a side effect of someone else work ?
In the opposite direction, if you are a player who is loosing its mind on a challenge, you won't be glad that someone broke the entire challenge thus your efforts are wortheless, isn't it ?
