## Challenge on Demand

The capacity of a CTF platform to empower a [source](#source) to deploy its own challenges autonomously.

## Scenario

It is the refinement of an artistic direction for a CTF.

In the case of Chall-Manager, it could be compared as the recipe of deployment for a given challenge.
Technically, the scenario is a Pulumi entrypoint written in Go that conforms to the SDK.
When launched, it deploys the [source](#source)'s infrastructure and return data such as the connection information or an instance-specific flag.

## Source

Either a team or user at the origin of a request.
For abstraction purposes, we consider it being the same under the use of the "source" term.

## Identity

An identity is a random 16-hex characters long string that identify an instance. It could be used as a PRNG seed, thus should as much as possible not be exposed to the players.

## Instance

An instance is the final product of a scenario once launched with an identity.

## Player

A player is a CTF participant who is going to manipulate instances of challenges throughout the lifetime of the event.

## ChallMaker

The designer of the challenge, often with a security expert profile on the category contributed to.
This is an essential role for a CTF event, as without them, the CTF would simply not exist !

Notice it is the **responsibility of the ChallMaker** to make its challenge **playable**, not the [Ops](#ops).
If you can't make your challenge run into pre-prod/prod, you can't blame the Ops.

They cooperate with plenty profiles:
- other ChallMakers to debate ideas and assess the difficulty ;
- [Ops](#ops) to make sure created challenges can reach production smoothly ;
- [Admins](#administrator) to discuss the technical feasibility of challenges, for instance if it requires FPGAs, online platforms as GCP or AWS, etc. or report on the status of the CTF ;
- an artistic direction, graphical designer, etc. to assist on the coherence of the challenge in the whole artistic process.

## Ops

The Operator of the event who ensure the infrastructure is up and running, everything runs untroubled thus players can compete.
They do not need to be security experts, but will most likely be thanks to the community a CTF bring together.

They are the rulers of the infrastructure, its architecture and its incidents. ChallMakers have often both fear and admiration as they enable playing complex scenarios but are one click away of destructing everything.

They collaborate with various profiles:
- other Ops as a rubber ducky, a mental support during an outage or simply to work in group and share expertises or past experiences ;
- [ChallMakers](#challmaker) to assist writing the [scenarios](#scenario) in case of a difficulty or a specific infrastructure architecture or requirement ;
- [Admins](#administrator) to report on the current lifecycle of the infrastructures, the incidents, or provide ideas for evolutions such as a partnership ;
- a technical leader to centralize the reflexions on architectures and means to enable the artistic direction achieving their goals.

## Administrator

The Administrator is the showcase of the event. They take responsibility and decisions during the creation process of the event, make sure to synchronize teams throughout the development of the artistic and technical ideas, and manage partnerships if necessary. They are the managers through the whole event, before and after, not only during the CTF.

They basically cooperate with **everyone**, which is a double-edged sword: you take the gratification of the whole effort, but have no time to rest. ðŸ¤·
