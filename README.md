Chall-Manager is a challenge instances on demand engine, designed to make managing CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges effortless.

Instead of juggling infrastructure details, container lifecycles, and scaling logic, Chall-Manager provides a unified abstraction layer to run and manage challenges reliably‚Äîwhether for a classroom, training environment, or large-scale competition.

> [!CAUTION]
> Chall-Manager is currently in public beta phase.
> It could be run in production, but breaking changes are subject to happen in the upcoming months until General Availability.

## üöÄ What Chall-Manager Does

- **Abstracts infrastructure** ‚Äì Run challenges locally, in Kubernetes, or across clouds without changing your workflows;
- **Manages challenge lifecycles** ‚Äì Create, start, stop, and clean up instances on demand;
- **Scales intelligently** ‚Äì Define minimum/maximum pool sizes, then automatically maintains the pool; pick from the pool whenever needed;
- **[Integrates with CTFd](https://github.com/ctfer-io/ctfd-chall-manager) and more** ‚Äì Is platform-agnostic, and has [Terraform](https://github.com/ctfer-io/terraform-provider-ctfdcm) and [Pulumi](https://github.com/ctfer-io/pulumi-ctfdcm) integrations for [CTFd](https://github.com/ctfd/ctfd);
- **Provides a [SDK](/sdk)** ‚Äì Build or reuse previous work, with the best trade-offs between capabilities, security by design and by default, and costs.

Whether you're running a single practice challenge or hundreds of dynamic containers, Chall-Manager takes care of the heavy lifting so you can focus on content and players.

## üß© Why Use Chall-Manager?

- **For Educators & Trainers** ‚Äì Run reproducible lab environments for students without dealing with manual resets;
- **For CTF Organizers** ‚Äì Handle thousands of ephemeral challenge instances with minimal ops overhead;
- **For Researchers & Developers** ‚Äì Use the abstraction layer to prototype new challenge backends or integrations.

Chall-Manager turns complex infrastructure problems into simple challenge management.

## üì¶ Installation

As a generic solution, many alternatives exist regarding deployment: please have a look [here](https://ctfer.io/docs/chall-manager/ops-guides/deployment/).

## ‚ö° Quick Start

Let's spin a quick Docker infra, then deploy one example !

```bash
# Start the infra
docker network create quickstart || true
docker run -d --network quickstart --name registry      -p 5000:5000 registry:3
docker run -d --network quickstart --name chall-manager -p 8080:8080 ctferio/chall-manager:latest --oci.insecure

# Compile chall-manager-cli
#   go build -o chall-manager-cli cmd/chall-manager-cli/main.go
#   mv chall-manager-cli "$(go env GOPATH)/bin/"
#
# Alternatively you could install it using
#   go install github.com/ctfer-io/chall-manager/cmd/chall-manager-cli@latest
#
# Or you can execute it on the fly using "go run cmd/chall-manager-cli/main.go"
# instead of "chall-manager-cli" in the next steps.

# Create a challenge
chall-manager-cli --url localhost:8080 challenge create \
    --id test \
    --scenario registry:5000/your-org/your-scenario:v0.1.0 \
    --dir examples/additional \
    --insecure

# Then create an instance
chall-manager-cli --url localhost:8080 instance create \
    --challenge_id test \
    --source_id test

# Optional: wipe out all Docker setup
docker stop registry chall-manager
docker rm registry chall-manager
docker network rm quickstart
```

This example does not actually deploy resources, you'll have to provide Chall-Manager additional capabilities to do so !
Look at the [tutorials](https://ctfer.io/docs/chall-manager/tutorials/) for what fits your use case.

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/ctfer-io/chall-manager/issues/new) to add your event to the list if we did not ourself.

## üî® Development setup

Once you clonned the repository, run the following commands to make sure you have all the generated files on your local system and up to date.

```bash
make buf
make update-swagger
```

You could also run those before a commit that affects the `*.proto` files to avoid inconsistencies between your local setup and the distant branch.

If you need to run a local etcd instance, you could use the following.

```bash
docker run -v /usr/share/ca-certificates/:/etc/ssl/certs -p 4001:4001 -p 2380:2380 -p 2379:2379 -e ETCD_ROOT_PASSWORD=root bitnami/etcd:3.5.13
```
