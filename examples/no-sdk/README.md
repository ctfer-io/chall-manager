# No-SDK

The No-SDK example provide you a Chall-Manager-SDK-free code for you to support the main features of a scenario.

You may want to manipulate further your stack or do pre-flight checks, thus do this.
In most cases, you should **not** do it, especially if you do not know what you are doing.

## Demo

To build the scenario archive you only need to run `./build.sh`.
It will compile the Pulumi Go code and create the zip archive (`scenario.zip`).
